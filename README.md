1.How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my work is functional and secure by running tests to make sure that my coverage is complete. Making sure that each line of code is tested and runs via testing such as JUnit tests can help to make sure that the code does not have errors or gaps that may not otherwise be picked up. You can make sure exceptions are thrown when they should be, and that the code functions as intended.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are gathered through requirement elicitation. By using these requirements to guide the actual coding, you can ensure that you are making the product as intended by the client. Following the given restrictions on description lengths, for example, you can write code that ensures a description is not null and is not longer than 50 characters. You can then run tests on that code to ensure that it is working as intended for the users needs.

2. How do I approach designing software?

To design software, I start with finding out what the requirements are. It is important to clarify exactly what the client is looking for before beginning to code so that time and energy are not wasted on the incorrect work. Once the requirements are known, writing code that meets these requirements are the next step. Then running tests on the code to ensure that the tests do not fail and running coverage to ensure that each line of code is checked correctly and throws exceptions when needed. Then it would be important to show the client the progress and ensure along the way that it is correct for what they were looking for.
